# Chat Application

This application is a real-time chat application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. It uses React with TypeScript for the frontend and Express.js with TypeScript for the backend, ensuring type safety and better code quality.

The frontend is built using Vite, which provides a fast and efficient development environment. With features like message history, user authentication, and real-time updates, the app offers a seamless user experience.

The backend handles routing, authentication, and data storage using Express.js. It integrates with WebSocket for real-time communication and uses TypeScript to define clear interfaces for APIs and database interactions.

For deployment, the application can be hosted on various platforms such as AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud Platform. The backend runs on Node.js, leveraging the strength of Express.js for handling HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.

This setup ensures that the application is scalable, maintainable, and ready to handle large numbers of users and messages.
